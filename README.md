## UserController.cs

The `UserController.cs` file is part of the Controllers in an MVC application. It manages user interactions, retrieves and sends data to the Model, and selects the View to display. The controller handles CRUD operations for users.

### Key Methods

- `Index()`: Displays the list of users.
- `Details(int id)`: Shows the details of a specific user.
- `Create()`: Displays the user creation form.
- `Create(User user)`: Processes the creation of a user.
- `Edit(int id)`: Displays the user edit form.
- `Edit(int id, User updatedUser)`: Processes the update of a user's information.
- `Delete(int id)`: Displays the confirmation for user deletion.
- `Delete(int id, FormCollection collection)`: Processes the deletion of a user.

## UserControllerTests.cs

The `UserControllerTests.cs` file would contain unit tests for the `UserController`, ensuring that each function behaves as expected. This file is crucial for maintaining code quality and reliability through automated testing.

(Note: The actual content for `UserControllerTests.cs` was not provided, so this section assumes the existence of such a file and its purpose.)

## deploy.json

The `deploy.json` file is an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that defines the infrastructure and configuration for deploying a web application to Azure. It specifies the resources to be deployed, such as web apps and service plans.

### Resources

- Microsoft.Web/serverfarms: Defines an App Service Plan.
- Microsoft.Web/sites: Defines a web app.

## deploy.parameters.json

The `deploy.parameters.json` file provides parameter values for the `deploy.json` ARM template. It allows for the customization of deployments without altering the main template.

### Parameters

- `webAppName`: The name of the web app.
- `hostingPlanName`: The name of the App Service Plan.
- `location`: The location for all resources (e.g., "westus").

# Executing ARM Template

To execute the ARM template and deploy the web application to Azure, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the Azure CLI installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `deploy.json` and `deploy.parameters.json` files are located.
4. Run the following command to deploy the template:
Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the Azure resource group where you want to deploy the web application.

5. Wait for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the progress in the Azure portal or by running the following command:
Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the Azure resource group and `<deployment-name>` with the name of the deployment.

Once the deployment is successful, your web application will be deployed to Azure.

This documentation provides an overview of the key components in the project and instructions for executing the ARM template. For detailed information, refer to the source code and Azure documentation.
